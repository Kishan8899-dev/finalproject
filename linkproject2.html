          <p style="font-family: sans-serif; padding: 5px;">Virat Kohli is an Indian international cricketer, counted amongst the top sportsmen in India. Considered to be among the best batsmen in the present era, he also doubles up as an occasional right-arm medium pace bowler. He is known for his dependable and powerful batting style and has single-handedly won several matches for India. Virat became fascinated with cricket quite early on in his life and took to the bat when he was just three. His parents recognized his potential and had him enrolled at the West Delhi Cricket Academy when he was nine years old. He developed into a very talented player over the ensuing years and represented his city Delhi at various age-group levels and domestic cricket. His first major success came in 2008 when he captained India Under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup. Soon he was selected to play for the Indian team and established himself as a valuable middle order player. After having gained a reputation as an “ODI specialist”, he has proved his mettle in test cricket as well. Currently, he is the captain of the Indian team in Test cricket and vice-captain in limited overs formats. Virat Kohli is married to famous Indian actress Anushka Sharma.

                <p style="font-family: sans-serif; padding:5px;"> M. S. Dhoni is an Indian cricketer best remembered for leading the Indian ODI team to its second World Cup win in 2011.

He debuted as a Test player against Sri Lanka on 2nd December 2005, and led the team in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. Known for his aggressive playing style, he is revered as one of the best "finishers" in the limited over format of the game. He is also one of the most successful Indian captains and holds a number of records for his captaincy. Notably, the Indian team became the No.1 Test team in 2009 under his captaincy. He also led the Indian team to win the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. While his achievements in the IPL format often get overshadowed by his international records, he also helped his team, Chennai Super Kings, win IPL twice in 2010 and 2011.  </p>

                <h2 style="background-color: lightblue; color: white; padding: 5px;">THE HITMAN</h2><br>
                <p style="font-family: sans-serif; padding:5px;"> Rohit Sharma is an Indian international cricketer who currently serves as the Vice captain of the Indian ODI and T20 teams. He is the captain of the Mumbai Indians IPL team. The right-handed batsman is better known as ‘The Hitman’ for his hard-hitting ability, and has scored a record three double-centuries in ODIs, with centuries in Test and T20 formats as well. Starting his career at the age of 20, he quickly earned praise for his calm and matured performance. However, a rough patch and an untimely injury had halted his ODI run and his Test debut during his early career. Thanks to the new IPL T20 competition, he was able to showcase his capacity as a batsman, an occasional bowler and a captain. He excelled especially in the limited-over formats after being promoted to the opening spot. Despite a delayed Test debut, he showed class with back-to back centuries in his first two matches.  </p>

                <h2 style="background-color: lightblue; color: white; padding: 5px;">THE GABBAR</h2><br>
                <p style="font-family: sans-serif; padding:5px;">Shikhar Dhawan is an Indian international cricketer and a left-handed opening batsman. He plays for Delhi in domestic cricket and Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL (Indian Premier League). He previously played for Delhi Daredevils and Mumbai Indians teams in the IPL. He came to limelight after scoring a record 505 runs from a single tournament in the 2004 Under-19 World Cup, but had to wait for his national debut because of the over-crowded line of successful openers in the Indian team such as Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir. He witnessed the blooming career of his opening pair from Challenger Trophy 2005, MS Dhoni, as well as younger Delhi batsman Virat Kohli, before he got his national cap at the age of 27. However, he utilized his experience from domestic cricket fully to establish himself as a run-machine and has cemented his position as an opener in the Indian team. He has recently been named the vice-captain of the Indian T20I team for the Tri-Series in Sri Lanka.  </p>

                <h2 style="background-color: lightblue; color: white; padding: 5px;"> THE CHINAMAN </h2><br>
                <p style="font-family: sans-serif; padding:5px;"> Kuldeep Yadav (born 14 December 1994) is an Indian cricketer who plays for India and for Uttar Pradesh in domestic cricket and for Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL.
